# flutter_canvas_code_editor

An editor for Dart code, built with the Flutter canvas, that looks and feels like the [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor), because:

- The power and control we get from building an editor with the canvas will make a code writing game mechanic possible where the text, cursor etc. are part of the game
- many people use VS Code so being Monaco-like will give a familiar and intuitive experience as well as providing clear design constraints so we can focus on building
